# Select3
This is a stripped fork of the excellent [bootstrap-select](https://silviomoreto.github.io/bootstrap-select/) widget. Translations were removed(sorry, bring your own) to keep things simple.

## Why?
* ES2015 is easier to read/maintain
* Integrates well with npm/browserify

## Usage
    npm install Select3

    # From your Browserify workflow code(e.g. vendor.js)
    const select3 = require('select3');
