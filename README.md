# Select3

This is a fork of the excellent [bootstrap-select](https://silviomoreto.github.io/bootstrap-select/) widget.
It's changed so it integrates more easily with Npm/Browserify and doesn't depend on
Bootstrap anymore.


## Usage
    npm install Select3

    # From your Browserify workflow code, e.g. vendor.js
    const select3 = require('select3');
